Write all new/edited content in ENGLISH (including SKILL.md frontmatter description and body).

Task: Add a small, repeatable troubleshooting note to the existing Codex skill for this repo.
Target file: `.codex/skills/aggregated-signal-figure/SKILL.md`

Workflow constraints (must follow):
1) Propose a brief plan first (what/where you’ll edit and why), then STOP and wait for my explicit approval: I will type "proceed".
2) After "proceed", apply the edit (keep it minimal; do not create a new skill).
3) Commit with a Korean git commit message.

What to add to the skill (English, simple):
- Add a short section describing:
  - Symptom
  - Root cause (why it happens)
  - Fix pattern (where it’s controlled in code/config)
  - “Reference implementation in this repo” with file path(s) to search
