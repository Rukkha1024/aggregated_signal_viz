# Progress V1

- Goal: in overlay scatter, encode window by color and group by marker shape only.
- Baseline image: progress/V1/step_TF_mean_cop_before.png
- Change: fix overlay scatter edgecolor to a neutral tone; group legend uses shape only.
- Sample output: output/step_TF/step_TF_mean_cop.png (after to be generated)
